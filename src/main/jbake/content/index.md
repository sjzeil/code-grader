# bcratchit - Automatic Grading of Programming Assignments

This project is the long-overdue replacement for the automatic grading script
that I have been using for over 20 years.

## Goals

Goals include

* ease of use
* automatic recognition of common use-cases, with smart defaults
* support for arbitrary programming languages, with common ones (C++, Java,
   Python) handled trivially
* flexible grading schemes
* support for testing in Docker containers or virtual machines.


## Status

Still at the conceptual stage.
