			<p><h1>code-grader - Automatic Grading of Programming Assignments</h1>
<p>This project is the long-overdue replacement for the automatic grading script (in Perl) that I have been using for over 25 years.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Goals include</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Support for arbitrary programming languages</li>
<li>Test oracle (evaluation of pass/fail) based on any of
<ul>
<li>pre-supplied expected output files</li>
<li>comparison of output against execution of a &quot;gold version&quot; of the code, supplied by the instructor</li>
<li>arbitrary instructor-supplied scripts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flexible grading schemes, including partial credit for common mistakes such as upper/lower-case mistakes and misspelled words in boilerplate text.</li>
<li>Student grade reports written to self-contained HTML files for ease of distribution to students</li>
<li>Class grade summaries written to CSV files so that instructors can import into grade books.</li>
<li>Easy integration with GitHub Classroom or other use of GitHub to support student submissions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status</h2>
<ul>
<li>In development</li>
<li>Key features have been prototyped in shell scripts and are being used to grade student programs in a summer 2022 Data Structures and Algorithms course.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<p>There are six critical directories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <em>Gold</em> directory (optional): Contains the instructor's code for the assignment.</p>
<p>This should be a full copy of the program that can be built and run. When provided, this is used to generate the expected test output and expected test run timings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Instructor Code</em> directory (optional), containing instructor code that must be combined with the student's<br />
to form the entire program.   If not specified, this defaults to the <em>Gold</em> directory (if that has been provided).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Submissions</em> directory, containing the submissions from all students, each in its own subdirectory. A student's individual submission directory contains all of a student's code, but may also contain copies of files provided to the student by the instructor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Tests</em> directory: Contains files that define how the project is to be built and tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Reporting</em> directory: where info about the performance of the students' submissions is placed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Staging</em> directory (optional): where the student code is collected, compiled, and tested.  By default, this<br />
is a temporary directory within the <em>Reporting</em> directory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Grading Model</h2>
<p><img src='https://sjzeil.github.io/code-grader/images/flow.png' align='right' style='max-width:66%;' /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Setup</p>
<ul>
<li>If the instructor has provided a Gold version, its source code is copied to the gold Stage.</li>
<li>If the instructor has provided a Gold version or Instructor code, that code is copied to the student Stage.</li>
<li>A student's submitted code is copied to the student Stage. This may supplement or overwrite the instructor-supplied code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build</p>
<ul>
<li>If a Gold version has been provided, the program in the gold Stage is built.</li>
<li>The student's program student Stage is built.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test</p>
<p>For each test case in the Test directory:<br />
* The test case info is copied into the student's Reporting directory, into the student Stage, and, if a gold version was provided, into the gold Stage.<br />
* If a Gold version was provided, the program in the gold Stage is run on that test case.<br />
* The program in the student Stage is run on that test case.<br />
* Student programs that run overly long are terminated.<br />
* If a Gold version was supplied, the time limit for the student's program is a multiple of the time taken by the Gold program on the same test case.<br />
* If no Gold program is available, the time limit can be specified as part of the test case configuration.<br />
* The output from the student program is scored.<br />
* By default, output from the student's submission is compared to output from the Gold program on the same test.<br />
* If no Gold program is available, output from the student's submission is compared to expected output provided as part of the test case info.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report</p>
<p>Build and test results are assembled into a CSV file for the instructor's gradebook and an HTML grade report<br />
for each student.</p>
</li>
</ol>
